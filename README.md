Gold Rush Lite 

This project is a game called Gold Rush Lite and the goal of the game is to get as much gold into the pan as possible. What the game does is both gold and dynamite will fall from the top of the
screen but you want to only collect the gold and not the dynamite because that will take away from your score. There is a 30 second timer and as the time increases so does the amount of gold and
dynamite that falls. The game is coded in c and uses X Window Systems to display the game.  

The game is usesful because it provides fun for busy students to overwhelmed professionals. The game is a place for them to get distracted from what they were doing and spend some time having fun
so they can recuperate. It's a easy game to play and doesn't use much brainpower to operate that why its a useful option to get away from doing something. 

So if you are a someone who would like to play this game you need to have access to the X Window Systems so you can acess the lX11 libraries. There are many different items out there you can install
so these graphics will work in your terminal. Depending on what type of computer you have and what it runs on will depend on what all you need to install for it to work. Once you have X11 downloaded
when logging into your terminal you will need to add -YC with your ssh. Than once you have the correct items installed to make the game work you need to compile and run it in your terminal. To compile you
need ggc since we are working in c then the file name which is goldrush.c, then the -Wall command to check for all warnings, then the -lX11 command to call all the libarires needed to run the program. 

This is what it ahould look like to compile and run it ggc goldrush.c -Wall -lX11 and ./a.out

For users to get help since we are in early development stages we do not yet have an instructional page, how-to page, or q&a page but we hope to later implement these guides in order to help our users
maximize their play time. 

The contributers to this project are Ryan Reddemann and Braden Smelser. They are also the ones who will maintain the project and fix any issues that occur in the future or add new content to the game
to keep it fresh and exciting.
